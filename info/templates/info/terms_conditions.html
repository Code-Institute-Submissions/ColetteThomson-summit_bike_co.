                    <p class="gen-text bg-text">
                        After placing your order, you will receive an automated order acknowledgement by email. Please note
                        that this does not mean that your order has been accepted. All orders are subject to acceptance by
                        Summit Bike Co. You will receive an email confirming that Summit Bike Co. has accepted your order when
                        your order has been processed and is ready for delivery by Summit Bike Co. Once Summit Bike Co. accepts
                        your order, a contract to purchase the goods from Summit Bike Co. takes effect between you and Summit
                        Bike Co. The contract to sell goods to you only relates to those goods listed in the confirmation email.
                        You will not be charged before your order has been processed and is ready for delivery. However, upon
                        receipt of your order, Summit Bike Co. will create an authorisation. This will show on your bank statement
                        as a reservation of funds which allocates the money to your order, but this will not be realised until
                        your order has been picked and processed in Summit Bike Co. warehouse. In the event of us not being able
                        to fulfil your order we will immediately request that your bank cancels the authorisation. If the
                        authorisation still remains after several days, please contact your bank to request that they act upon
                        our cancellation of the payment.
